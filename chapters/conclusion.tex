\chapter{Conclusion}

Indoor localization systems and wireless technologies were reviewed.
This study attempts to provide a thorough understanding of localization techniques and technologies utilized in indoor contexts.
The survey provides an overview of localization system technologies such as satellite navigation, inertial navigation systems, magnetic navigation, sound-based technologies, optical-based technologies, and radio frequency-based technologies.
The paper also looks into approaches for detecting localization, such as proximity-based techniques, scene analysis, triangulations, and dead reckoning.
Finally, the study discusses the most widely used localization techniques and approaches, such as \acf{aoa}, \acf{toa}, and \acf{rss}.
Choosing a localization method is influenced by a variety of criteria, including cost, available resources, environment type, and desired precision; the most powerful strategy is one that provides high accuracy with minimal processing.
