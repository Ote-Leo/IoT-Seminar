    The objective of this study is to offer a comprehensive review on \ac{iot} localization approaches and technologies.
    The study begins with the current localization methods and analyses comparisons in terms of their accuracy, cost, benefits, and drawbacks.
    In addition, the research compares several detection strategies in terms of accuracy and cost.
    Finally, localization methods and algorithms are provided, such as \ac{aoa}, \ac{toa}, and \ac{rss}.
    The research includes ideas, requirements, and specifications for each technique category, as well as advantages and disadvantages for the examined methods and comparisons between them.
